Maze Solver in Java
This project is a maze-solving algorithm built in Java using recursive backtracking. It reads a maze from a file and finds a path from the starting point to the exit, while marking dead ends and the correct path.

Features
Implements recursive backtracking to explore all possible paths in the maze.
Reads maze layouts from external files, making the program flexible and adaptable to different mazes.
Marks the solved path and dead ends for visualization.
Supports custom maze layouts of any size.
How to Run
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Ensure the maze file path is correctly set in the code.
Compile and run the program using a Java compiler.
Example Maze File Format
X: Represents walls in the maze.
+: Starting point.
-: Exit point.
The maze should be structured as a grid of characters, with walls, paths, and the start/exit points defined.
